Welcome to my progress journal for the Quality Engineering'23

Student ID: 2019402045

Below I will provide the necessary links for the first Part of our Project.

Link to the .html file of our work on the Github Repository: https://github.com/BU-IE-423/fall-23-SNB2908/blob/07dc3a4a7ced7513354707b3f794f676d8bf06d3/files/Project_part1.html

Note that you need to download the .html file after clicking this link. Since it is too big for Github, they don't show the file before downloading.

Link to the .ipynb file on the Github Repository: https://github.com/BU-IE-423/fall-23-SNB2908/blob/07dc3a4a7ced7513354707b3f794f676d8bf06d3/files/Project%20Part%201/Project_part1.ipynb

Necessary .csv files to execute the .ipynb file are also available under the files folder under Project Part 1 Folder.
